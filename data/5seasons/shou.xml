				<![CDATA[Black Chao was raised in the farming village of 山麓 /// Shanlu. It is situated in the foothills of the Pazruki mountain range which culminates in eastern @[[Chukei]]. Shanlu produces rice, wheat, millet, and livestock which are taken south via Kuang Chu Road for trade and tribute.

				![Xero](https://i.imgur.com/zwotpfS.jpg)
				## 芷若 /// Li Zhi Ruo (Xero)
				The archdruid of the Mogu Chóng Bài in Chukei. She is considered one of the prime (but not the only) hierophants of the Mogu in Shou. Spore druids face strong resistance from druidkind against expansion of the faith. Xero is a veteran of the hidden war pitching druid against druid in skirmishes against Mogu temples and nodes which stray too far into the protected lands of other mainline druidic faiths. Druids do work together when times call for unity, but like all communities they have their imperfections and conflicts. Xero is human, with an extremely faint lineage of Korobokuru very far up in her ancestral line.

				![Balthazar](https://i.imgur.com/8J4n8O0.jpg)
				## Balthazar
				A Faerunian Mogu druid residing in the caves beneath the foothills of the Pazruki mountains in Chukei and far north. Balthazar had committed an unknown crime many years ago and fled to Shou. He was recruited by the Mogu and has lived in Chukei ever since. Balthazar is the first Mogu to encounter Chao Ping, and he is his druidic teacher and mentor. Balthazar is a fierce fighter wielding scimitar and sickle. He may have been a guard or a mercenary in his previous life. Balthazar is a Mogu zealot, and is entrusted with secret missions from Xero. Zealots like Balthazar are free to commit acts of terror without being associated with Mogu  leadership. He often operates without assistance or backing from the Mogu. Balthazar is a good teacher, but Chao Ping is headstrong and does not fully accept an extremist point of view.]]>

Tai Tung is a hub for seedier goods and services. Humans are not as dominant in Tai Tung as the rest of Shou. The mayor has a deal with the Shou government that no state controlled birds are allowed within city limits. There is an [[amusement park|everfair]](tai_tung) here.

There are stories of many aspiring Red Rat Rebels attempting to break out friends and colleagues, only to be caught and imprisoned themselves. Nobles and bureaucrats live in the southern district known as @[[Brilliance Ascent]](linshung).
